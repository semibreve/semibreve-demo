# Semibreve Demo Application
A demonstration of the [Semibreve](https://github.com/semibreve/semibreve) multi-user authentication library.

## Prerequisites
You'll need to have a web server installed and configured with PHP for this to work. I really recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), especially for Windows users. Once you've done that you can proceed.

You'll also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed and working.

## Building
Clone the project down and open the folder in your favourite editor. It's a JetBrains PhpStorm project but you can use whichever paid/free software takes your fancy.

Before anything else, note that this project uses the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager. Install composer (see their website) and run:

```
composer install
```

Or alternatively, if you're using the PHAR (make sure the `php.exe` executable is in your PATH):

```
php composer.phar install
```

Then, install the npm packages necessary to build and run the website. Run the following in your terminal in the project root directory:

```
npm install
```

This will install [Bower](https://bower.io/) which will allow you to install the assets the website requires (Bootstrap, jQuery etc.) using the command:

```
bower install
```

Gulp will also have been installed. This will compile the [Less](http://lesscss.org/) into CSS ready for production. Do this using the command:

```
gulp
```

This command will need running again every time you make a change to a Less file. If you're working on them, run `gulp watch` in a terminal to watch for file changes and compile accordingly.

## Configuration
This demo application comes with a set of default credentials.

```
Email: me@example.com
Password: demo
```

These *must* be changed before you go into production. Set everything up according to [the configuration guide for Semibreve](https://github.com/semibreve/semibreve).

## Limitations
Don't rely on Semibreve to be secure out of the box and always perform your own penetration testing.
